            <p>
                My name is Patrick King and I am currently a Kinesiology and Exercise Science major at George Mason University. 
                My passion for human movement and technology intertwine in my roles as an 
                Undergraduate Student Researcher and a Research Assistant. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With a foundation in Computer Science from Northern Virginia Community College, 
                I enjoy coding projects and data analysis relevant to the medical world.

                An intership I participated in during the summer of 2024 involved 
                interviewing subjects to further explore people's chronic pain
                experience. This was done under the OSCAR program at George Mason University. This research was a qualitative study that required
                transcription of hour long interviews. I proposed we create a transcription
                application that the team could use instead of painfully manually transcribing.
                The application would take in an audio file and output a text file of the transcription, but
                there were a few caveats. The application had to be offline, as the interviews contained 
                sensitive medical and personal data. The project me and a colleague created was an offline
                transcription model that could transcribe, diarrize, and remove personal information 
                all on a secure encrypted server.
